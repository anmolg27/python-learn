# 04. Operators and Expressions ðŸ”¢

## What are Operators?

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Python has several types of operators that let you perform calculations, comparisons, and logical operations.

## Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform mathematical calculations:

```python
a = 10
b = 3

# Addition
print(a + b)    # 13

# Subtraction
print(a - b)    # 7

# Multiplication
print(a * b)    # 30

# Division (always returns float)
print(a / b)    # 3.3333333333333335

# Floor Division (returns integer)
print(a // b)   # 3

# Modulo (remainder)
print(a % b)    # 1

# Exponentiation (power)
print(a ** b)   # 1000

# Negative
print(-a)       # -10
```

### Order of Operations (PEMDAS)

Python follows the standard mathematical order of operations:

```python
result = 2 + 3 * 4 ** 2
print(result)  # 50 (not 80!)

# Breakdown:
# 1. 4 ** 2 = 16
# 2. 3 * 16 = 48
# 3. 2 + 48 = 50

# Use parentheses to control order
result = (2 + 3) * 4 ** 2
print(result)  # 80
```

## Assignment Operators

These operators assign values to variables:

```python
x = 5
print(x)  # 5

# Addition assignment
x += 3    # Same as x = x + 3
print(x)  # 8

# Subtraction assignment
x -= 2    # Same as x = x - 2
print(x)  # 6

# Multiplication assignment
x *= 4    # Same as x = x * 4
print(x)  # 24

# Division assignment
x /= 3    # Same as x = x / 3
print(x)  # 8.0

# Floor division assignment
x //= 2   # Same as x = x // 2
print(x)  # 4.0

# Modulo assignment
x %= 3    # Same as x = x % 3
print(x)  # 1.0

# Exponentiation assignment
x **= 3   # Same as x = x ** 3
print(x)  # 1.0
```

## Comparison Operators

These operators compare values and return True or False:

```python
a = 5
